- Use semantic IDs (data-semantic-id) as targets for all actions
- Clickable elements are listed in CLICKABLE ELEMENTS section
- Input elements are listed in INPUT ELEMENTS section with their types and current values
- For menus items, try to hover it first to see if there is a dropdown menu.

2. Identify what needs to be done to progress toward the goal
3. Choose the most appropriate action to take next
4. Consider if you have enough information to complete the task
5. If the task is complete or impossible, use the terminate action

Think step by step about what you see on the page, what the objective requires, and what action would best progress toward completing the task.

Your response should follow this format:
